{"Lyric":{"110":"you with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again got me feeling like i'm nothing you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when i'm wounded you picking on the weaker man  pre well you can take me down with just one single blow but you don't know what you don't know   someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean   you with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again as if i don't already see them i walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you i just wanna feel okay again  pre i bet you got pushed around somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 'cause you can't lead me down that road and you don't know what you don't know   someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean   and i can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game with that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing but all you are is mean all you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life and mean and mean and mean and mean  breakdown but someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean yeah   someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean someday i'll be living in a big old city why you gotta be so mean and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me why you gotta be so mean and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean"}}
